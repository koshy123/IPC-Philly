            <p>IPC Philly was started in 1990 by the guiding of the Holy Spirit through our founding Senior Pastor Welsey Daniel.
                Their humble start was in a Days In hotel in Philadelphia, PA. To later moving into a rental building, from a church. 
                Now, by God's grace we were able to purchase our own building on Craig st. With plans to move into a larger facility with our growing congregation.
