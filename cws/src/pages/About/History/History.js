            In 1990, IPC Philly was birthed through the divine guidance of the Holy Spirit, under the visionary leadership of our founding Senior Pastor, Welsey Daniel. With humble beginnings at a Days Inn hotel in Philadelphia, PA, our congregation flourished. We transitioned from a rental building to a dedicated church space, and now, through God's abundant grace, we have proudly acquired our own building on Craig St. As our congregation continues to grow, we eagerly anticipate a future move to an even larger facility, propelled by our unwavering faith and the unity that binds us together.
