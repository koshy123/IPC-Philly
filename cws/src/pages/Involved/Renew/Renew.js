We have been fortunate enough to see young people from all over the city of Philadelphia gather and spend time in worship, fellowship, and meditation of the scriptures. Our topics are either teaching series with speakers from the city or a book studies. Our prayer is to equip this generation with Godâ€™s Word and send them out into schools, campuses, and workplaces as heralds of the Gospel. </p>
