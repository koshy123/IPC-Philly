Visit the custom domain
Live Site- www.ipcphillychurch.org


## Overview 
The goal of the site is to provide information about their organization, similar to a business website or a charity's website. There is also a backend for new users to submit a contact form, which utilizes nodemailer.


## Installation
After doing a git clone, just run "npm install" to install all dependencies needed to run the site. Then, run "npm run start" from the root folder to open the project on your local host.
good luck 

## Languages 
javascript, react.js, node.js, css, express.js

## Backend
[github repo](https://github.com/koshy123/ipcBackend)
the backend contains a contact form. 

## Current Project 
Currently I am building a calender for the website. This is because the previous API calender I used asked me to sign up for a premium subscription. This calender will have full CRUD and only certain users can us it.
