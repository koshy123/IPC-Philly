# IPC-Philly

Live Site- www.ipcphillychurch.org


## Overview 
IPC-Philly is a small, local, cultural, and religious organization. Upon hearing that the previous member who ran their website had not maintained it, and thus it was taken down, I offered to help build a new site from scratch using my knowledge in React.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS. 
The goal of the site is to provide information about their organization, similar to a business website or a charity's website. There is also a backend for new users to submit a contact form, which utilizes nodemailer.


## Installation
After doing a git clone, just run "npm install" to install all dependencies needed to run the site. Then, run "npm run start" from the root folder to open the project on your local host.

## Backend
[github repo](https://github.com/koshy123/ipcBackend)
