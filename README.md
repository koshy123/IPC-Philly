# IPC-Philly

Live Site- www.ipcphillychurch.org


## Overview 
IPC-Philly is a small, local, cultural, and religious organization. Upon hearing that the previous member who ran their website had not maintained it, and thus it was taken down, I offered to help build a new site from scratch by using my knowledge in React.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS.
The goal of the site is to give information about their organization, simliar to a business website, or charities wesbite. There is also a backend, for new users to submit a contact form, which is using nodemailer. 


## Installation
After doing git clode, just run "npm install", to install all dependeies needed to run the site.
Then run  "npm run start", once in the root folder. To open the project on your local host.
